## Skipped Issues (Do Not Re-validate)

<!-- Issues validated but deemed not worth fixing. Do not re-validate these in future iterations. -->
<!-- Format: [file:line-range] | [severity] | [reason skipped] | [issue summary] -->
<!-- NOTE: Skips should be RARE - only purely cosmetic issues with no functional impact -->

src/cli/channel-command.ts:22 | Medium | Stylistic - Commander pattern standard | limit typed as string, parsed inline (common Commander.js pattern)
src/slack/channels.ts:190-192 | Low | Self-documenting code | normalizeConversationsLimit clamping rationale (function name + Math.min/max self-evident)
test/channel-command.test.ts:17-21 | Medium | Test architecture preference | Mock not configurable per-test (marginal benefit for current test scope)
